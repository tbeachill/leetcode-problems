# 193. Valid Phone Numbers

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

### Example:
Assume that `file.txt` has the following content:
```
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
```
Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:
```
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890
```
